Software development drew me in early. I worked at Wright Patterson Air Force Base the summer before college and taught myself Python, Linux, and Bash. I did a year at Ohio State followed by four month internships at both IBM and Marathon Petroleum. 

Then I did some soul searching. I participated in the [WWOOFing program](https://wwoofusa.org/) and worked on organic farms in Washington, Oregon, and Michigan. Spent some time living in Detroit working in the urban agriculture scene there. Worked in restaurants. Completed two seasons as a farm apprentice in Ohio. Did a [ten day meditation retreat](https://medium.com/@brandonfannin/vipassana-meditation-a-reflection-after-a-week-8e2fb800c295). Got a degree in Creative Writing. 

But I couldn't stay away from software. Small farmers have gaps in organization that can be filled by software. Critical analysis of literature can benefit from modern advances in machine learning and natural language processing. I completed [Tech Elevator](https://www.techelevator.com) coding bootcamp to renew old skills and gain some new ones. 

My long-term career goal is to work in the machine learning space to humanize data backed decision making and create software to aid farmers in sustainability. 

Outside of programming I like camping, backpacking, hiking, running, cooking, and gardening.
